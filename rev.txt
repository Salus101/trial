Using Color
The 4 main ways to define colors
*Using color names
*Using hex values - using hex values eg. #000000
*Using RGB notation - uses the decimal number system
-its notation is like: rgb(0,0,255)
-the values of rgb range from 0 to 255
-Relates directly to how computers generate color

*Using HSL notation
-HSL stands for hue, saturation & lightness
-Organizes color in a way of color wheel

Advantages of color names:
*Easy to use and remember
*Works very well with basic colors

Disadvantages of color names
*Only 16 color names are validated by CSS and HTML
*It is dificult to modify color
*Color names are subjective
*Color names are hard to match 

Advantages of hex values
*Bigger colour pallette(16 million)
*Colors are objective and precise
*Flexibility as in can easily change the tint of color

Disadvatages of hex values
*cryptic to learn at first

NB:All number based coloring systems have same advntg & disadvtg as hex

Characteristics of HSL Notation
Hue - The basic color in the color wheel
 *Color wheel is broken into a series of hues
 *The range is from 0 to 360

Saturation - richness of the color in percentage
 *reducing all saturation, image becomes gray-scale

Lightness - amount of light in the color

Color Theory Schemes
*Use mathematical relations and color wheel to determine colors that work well

Basic color schemes
*Monochromatic 
-Use single base color and a number of variations of shade
-Nice when emphasizing one color
*Complementary
-Use the opposite of the base color for contast and the base color itself
*Analogous
-Use the base hue and its two neighbors in the color wheel
*Acented analogous
-Uses the analogous and complementary color scheme
*Triad
-Uses colors that are evenly spaced around color wheel
*Tetrad
-The scheme uses four hues


Working with CSS

The three levels of applying css
*Local styles: defined by specifying s style within html element
-Useful for converting MsWord to HTML
-Useful when quickly testing a style on a particular element
-Have high priority than the other levels of applying css
-Any style that is put locally will override any similar style put in the other levels

Disadvantage of Local style
*Inefficiency - only style an element at a time
*Readability - mixing css and html in one page makes it difficult to read
*Lack of separation - no separation of content and style
*Quote problems - Both html and css require quotes hence difficulty reading


*Page-level styles: defined in the page's header area
-Ideal for development purposes
-Becoz browsers don't cache page level styles like in external styles

*External styles: defined on a separate document, linked to html
-saved as a .css file extension

Advntgs of External style sheets
*One style sheet can control many pages
*Global changes are easier 
- one change in a place is automatically propagated to all pages
*Separation of content and design
*Easy upgrades 
-One can easily change the site without messing with indiidusl html files

Block and Inline Elements
-Every html element has a default display styling
-It is either block or inline 


Characteristics of Block elements
*Always start on a new line
*Take up the full with as possible, they stretch out
Examples of block level elements include: <div>,<h1>,<h6>,<p>


Characteristics of inline elements
*Do not start on a new line
*Only take as much space as necessary
Examples are <span>, <a>, <img>

Page Layout
*The most common technique for most applications is floating layout

Floating Layout
*This technique keeps the html layout as simple as possible
*Tells various elements how to interact with each other
*Provide hints to the elements and browser manages everything
*Ensures flexibility bcoz browser will try to follow the intentions no matter its size
*If user resizes browser, page flexes to fit new size and shape

Using CSS float property
Each div in this example above
